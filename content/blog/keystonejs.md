description: Learning a CMS while learning GraphQL
---
If you sat me down right now and asked me, "So Dustin, Which end of webdevelopment do you enjoy the most?" I would probably answer backend. 

I love solving the problems that the back end faces, but as a mostly freshfaced web developer I am not fully in tune with the way the web works. Much of my early coding in web has been trying to play catch up with a lot of terms that probably are outdated by the time I learned them. Quickly I saw that happening and decided to try to outpace myself in terms of learning.

Shortly after I wrote my first API I learned of GraphQL, as someone who just wrote their first API and hated testing it with something like Postman, I LOVED the idea. I can just tell it to give me specific parts and I dont have to individually code it all!? Sign me up! I realized it wasnt so easy as that soon after. In game-night I needed/think I need a database layer for some storage and room information, remembering about GraphQL I decided to leverage it's abilities to help with this. Just before i set out for my journey I realized for what I wanted out of game-night, a document database is a bit overkill and not needed. But I still wanted to learn GraphQL and use it.

A Friend of mine's wife posts these cute web comics on her Instagram page frequently and I think she does an amazing job at them, and inspired by that I thought she deserved a website. A great time to learn a few more things I need in tthe professional level so I decided it would be a good time to work on a project that web comic authors could potentially clone to quickly set up a site of their own.

The plan is to leverage KeystoneJS as a CMS which will give me GraphQL out of the box. After using it to set up a test page to query the DB to get comics and their related data, GraphQL is actually all I ever wanted, Its great! The biggest wall for me right now is the actual CMS behind KeystoneJS. I dont think its a very high wall. Quickly I've been able to make a quick and dirty 'comsumer' side of the site, using the keystone admin pages to populay\te the DB with 'comics' so now the bigger hurdle is in the artists' end. How can I get this userfriendly for the author/artist to make posting comics easy. 

Solving these issues will actually help me understand a couple of the largets hurdles I've had as a dev. Auth and storage. Auth I have the msot experience with. I've completed courses online that helped me implement auth in many different ways, but I wantt to be able to fully understand it. As securing a web page is very important, its the one thing I must understand the ins and outs of. Storage I think should be simpler, but in the end it just comes down to understanding the structure of my stack and its capabilities. A small site could possibly get away with self hosting files/images and be fine, but scaling it up is what I must understand here. All of these tasks, and I am sure more I have yet to uncover, will be a great source of knowledge for myself, and I am excited to progress on.
