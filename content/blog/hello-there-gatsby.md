Gatsby seems to be exactly what I have been looking for.

Gone is my old attempt at working on a blog site through Jekyll and in are the days of Gatsby. Jekyll was nice an all but as a site gen built in ruby, it was a bit cumbersome for me to work with. Its been months since I even touched it but I remember looking through docs for the Linux subsystem for Windows to even get it to work (OK I'm sure i could have used git bash thinking back on it now, but I'm sure back then I knew this but wanted to experiment more).

So today here I am getting Gatsby up and running. Admittedly I don't even have it working right now. Im trying to use Netlify's CMS and hosting for this project as a way to familiarize myself with a sort of CI solution. So all of this is new to me. I'm just fairly certain I fixed the bug for why the site wont build and deploy so I'm just here typing this on my 'gatsby develop' server. I'm going to copy all of this before publishing, just in case...
