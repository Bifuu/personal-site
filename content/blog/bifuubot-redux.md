description: Can this guy stick to a project!?
---
Ok ok ok. Yes I need to stick to a project, but man has it been crazy lately. Since my last post a friggen Pandemic has swept the world, I'm taking time away from work (Service industry, no insurance, I don't want to risk it), and I'm finally getting my code legs back in place.

Taking a step back and looking at my failures teaches me a bunch, and one of those failures is my inability to stick with a project. BifuuBot part 2 is a great thing to keep that going for myself. My friends and I are always on Discord talking, and having a neat bot to mess with just helps with keeping everyone entertained. 

The direction I want to take the bot will help me in many different directions:

1. Coding

Simple, I have to code the bot, Im writing this one in typescript to help keep everything sane. Javascript is great but every now and then I just wish I had some Type safety on my classes and objects, now I do. Typescript knowledge I feel can take me further than plain JS can, mostly because TS is JS after all, and TS is used more in the enterprise settings from what I can tell.

2. Linux

Well I want to run the bot on my Raspberry Pi, I have sitting in my room, Its a great little device that can support my many projects as I develop them. My raspberry pi will be the host of my databases I plan on using as well. Navigating the linux shell has always been daunting and now I get to take the leap fully. I have already learned a lot just getting the bot running, from separating my apps into their own users, to chmods and chowns, Its getting that hands on experience that is really helping.

3. Development processes.

Using Git and multiple discord bots, I am embracing a proper dev flow in terms of a production build and a dev build. I can break one bot without completely affecting the other! Now to make a new discord server before I drive my friend insane with my new commands.

4. Web

A future addition to the bot will be a web interface for controlling it. Right now my bot can play sounds that have to be placed in a folder after you manually convert them to an .ogg file. I would like to do this over a simple web interface. This will be one of my bigger challenges but I plan on breaking that process down in chunks instead of trying to over optimize before I even have the code written.



Hopefully this will be the project that kicks me off and gets me going. Stay tuned to the blog for further updates! And check out the code at my [Github](https://github.com/Bifuu/BifuuBot).
